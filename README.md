## 🎯 Project Objectives
The objective is to develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making. 

### Data Engineering Specifications - Building the Data Warehouse
- **Data Sources:** Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.
- **Data Quality:** Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis.
- **Integration:** Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.
- **Scope:** Focus on the lastest dataset only; historisation of data is not required.
- **Documentation:** Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.
